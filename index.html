			<h2>overview</h2>
				<p>my research is an effort to understand human 
				linguistic capacity. how do we coordinate multiple sources of information 
				to comprehend language? how is this coordination affected by the structure 
				of our language? my research draws inspiration from linguistics and 
				cognitive psychology, and can best be described as an intersection of 
				<strong>psycholinguistics</strong>&mdash;the study of how grammatical 
				principles are deployed in real-time comprehension, 
				and how these interact with the cognitive architecture of humans&mdash;and 
				<strong>linguistic fieldwork</strong>&mdash;a collaborative enterprise 
				between a linguist and a community of speakers to document and analyze 
				the structure of a particular language.</p>
				<p>i focus primarily on the description and analysis of 
				austronesian languages, a family of some 1200 languages dispersed over 
				southeast asia and the pacific. i specialize in 
				<strong>tagalog</strong> and using types of data available to me as a fieldworker 
				and an experimental syntactician, i produce a fuller, empirically 
				richer picture of tagalog morphosyntax. this richer picture then sets 
				the stage for my experimental investigations. as a psycholinguist, i am 
				interested in the types of linguistic information that comprehenders attend 
				to and use when processing non-local dependencies. i look at processing
				asymmetries to see how these classes of information interact.</p>

				<h2>relative clause (a)symmetries in tagalog</h2>
					<p>this is joint work with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/">matt wagers</a>. 
					i gave a talk at <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/cuny2020/">cuny 2020</a> 
					about this project and here is a link to the <a href="https://zoom.us/rec/play/6ZwkJemt-mo3TIXD5gSDB_8oW43pKK-shCUZ-6EIyUa0VHdSY1GkZOQUZOD__KZA1eUqR408TA8Z7yI6?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=r4aHUgSeSfyJlfK3bXmVhw.1586796835060.8550ff5dbc88f2d0208c95e6f89c7724&_x_zm_rhtaid=337">video</a>. 
					it starts around 3:05:40.</p>
					<p><strong>subject-gap relative clauses</strong> (src; the dog that chased the piglet) 
					are said to be easier to process than <strong>object-gap relative clauses</strong> 
					(orc; the dog that the piglet chased). 
					this asymmetry extends across languages and methods. 
					different classes of proposals emphasize distinct aspects of the dependency. 
					some have emphasized the role of syntactic structure. others have 
					emphasized the role of working memory, and others, the role of linguistic 
					experience. </p>
						
					<p>in this project, we leverage various features of tagalog 
					morphosyntax to evaluate the empirical coverage of these classes of proposals. 
					we also examine the types of linguistic information that tagalog 
					comprehenders attend to that can modulate this asymmetry, 
					like the relative order of the head noun and the rc, and the referential type of 
					the intervening co-argument.</p>
						
					<p>as participants heard a sentence containing a relative clause, 
					their eye movements were recorded. after hearing the sentence, 
					they had to choose the picture that best corresponded to what they had heard, 
					and to rate how confident they were with their response. 
					analyses of the participants’ eye movement data are still in progress, 
					but their choice data and confidence ratings indicate an asymmetry
					which can then be neutralized by word order and the pronominality of the co-argument. 
					the asymmetry always persisted in their RTs, however. </p>

				<h2>dependency formation in tagalog</h2>
					<p>this is joint work with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/">matt wagers</a>.
					this has been published in <em>frontiers in psychology</em> and here's a link to the 
					<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00517/full">article</a>.</p>
						
					<p> when processing <strong>filler-gap dependencies</strong> (fgds), comprehenders do not 
					wait until they encounter all of the bottom-up information in the input. 
					instead, they use various types of linguistic information to 
					predictively posit a gap that would allow the dependency to be 
					resolved. they can use syntactic, lexical, morphological, and prosodic 
					information. in this project, we examine whether tagalog comprehenders use the 
					language’s <strong>voice morphology</strong> to guide their incremental interpretations.
					we hypothesized that voice allows comprehenders to commit to an 
					interpretation upon encountering the verb, 
					since they have information about the event structure at this point in time
					and by virtue of voice, the thematic role of the filler.</p>
						
					<p>in experiment 1, using an acceptability judgment study, we found that 
					comprehenders differed in how they used the different voices in 
					different filler-gap contexts to detect the licitness of extractions. 
					these differences may have consequences for how voice is used in 
					real-time. in experiments 2 and 3, using the stops-making-sense paradigm, 
					comprehenders used voice as a cue to actively associate the filler with the gap. 
					however, in experiment 3, the way in which they used voice varied by 
					type and varied across types of filler-gap dependencies. we argue 
					that comprehenders were using construction-specific cue validities 
					when processing filler-gap dependencies. however, they also engaged 
					with other classes of linguistic information, including (but not 
					limited to) information about the structural similarities and the 
					thematic complexity of the dependencies involved, and the 
					relative frequency of the different types of voices in the language. 
					These interactions resulted in processing asymmetries.</p>

				<h2>extraction restriction in tagalog, revisited</h2>
					<p>voice has been central to many investigations in austronesian syntax 
					because it interacts with case marking, voice morphology, and a-bar movement. 
					this project revisits the interaction between voice and a-bar movement in tagalog. 
					the received view is that the extraction restriction is clean-cut: 
					only the argument that is cross-referenced by voice is eligible for a-bar movement. 
					when the verb exhibits <strong>agent voice</strong> (av), only the agent is extractable. 
					when the verb exhibits <strong>patient voice</strong> (pv), only the patient is extractable. 
					when the verb exhibits the various flavors of applicative morphology, only the applied object is extractable.</p>
						
					<p>i conducted a series of acceptability judgment studies and found that speakers 
					indeed gave high ratings when the extracted argument was cross-referenced by voice. 
					however, some speakers also gave surprisingly high ratings when 
					the extracted argument was an agent even when not cross-referenced by voice. 
					i supplemented my judgment studies with computational evidence 
					that modeled the participants’ judgment process using the framework established 
					by <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/650309/summary">dillon et al (2017)</a>. 
					i found that participants were indeed drawing from acceptable and unacceptable 
					sampling distributions when rating agent-extractions when not cross-referenced 
					by voice (instead of drawing from an intermediate acceptability distribution). 
					these results suggest that there may be subtle but categorical distinctions 
					in individual speakers’ grammars, in the vein of <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/210719">
					han, lidz, and musolino (2007)</a>. 
					in other words, there may be at least two grammars of extraction operative 
					in tagalog: one conservative, one permissive. when the extracted argument 
					is cross-referenced by voice, the linguistic output of these grammars converge. 
					their output diverge only when we look at the speakers’ behavior when 
					the extracted argument is not cross-referenced by voice.</p>
						
					<p>i am prepping this for submission. an earlier version of 
					this work was presented at the 25th annual meeting of the austronesian
					formal linguistics association in taiwan back in 2018.</p>

				<h2>lexical access in dabaw bisaya</h2>
					<p>how are morphologically complex words represented mentally in the lexicon? 
					different models of lexical processing make different claims about the 
					nature of these representations. there are three main classes of models 
					that have been proposed. on one end, full-listing models argue for 
					holistic representations. under this view, holistic representations 
					are used for recognition, and the morphological relationship 
					between words is an epiphenomenon. that is, constituent morphemes may 
					become activated and may influence post-lexical processing, 
					but morphological information is not crucial at the level of recognition. 
					on the other end, decompositional models maintain that complex words 
					are automatically decomposed into constituent morphemes, a process 
					called morphological decomposition. under this view, morphological 
					information is leveraged by the parser, and complex words are 
					recognized via the root morpheme. in the middle, hybrid models allow 
					for both holistic and decompositional processing.</p>

					<p>i investigated how the lexical representation of 
					related forms in dabaw bisaya, an austronesian language spoken in davao 
					city, philippines, is affected by nasal substitution, a morpho-phonological 
					process that obscures the onset of the root. i conducted a lexical 
					decision experiment with auditory masked priming to investigate this, 
					in lieu of the more commonly used visual masked priming technique, 
					since the language has no standardized orthography.</p>
						
					<p>i found no evidence for priming when participants were presented 
					with a morphologically related prime that has undergone nasal substitution. 
					participants had faster decision times, however, when presented with 
					the same prime or a morphologically related prime whose root 
					remained transparent. these results suggest that models of lexical 
					processing that leverage morphological information during word recognition
					 have better empirical coverage, with the proviso that surface opacity 
					 may modulate morphological decomposition. i presented these findings at 
					 <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mtlc2017/">the morphological typology and linguistic cognition workshop</a> in lexington, ky.</p>

				<h2>deriving relative clauses in dabaw bisaya</h2>
					<p>this is work in progress and is in collaboration with 
					<a href="https://jakewvincent.github.io/">jake vincent</a>.</p>

					<p>like tagalog, dabaw bisaya has four types of relative clauses&mdash;
					a typologically rare property for languages to have. first, db has head-initial rcs, 
					where the head noun precedes the RC (e.g., ). second, it also has head-final rcs, 
					where the head noun follows the RC (e.g., ). third, it also has head-medial rcs, 
					where the head noun surfaces what seems to be inside the rc (e.g., ). 
					finally, it also has headless rcs, where there seems to be no head noun.</p> 
					<p>the goal of this project is to compare the empirical coverage of 
					various proposals proposed in the austronesian literature to account 
					for how the different types of rcs are derived in dabaw bisaya. 
					we ask whether the different rc configurations share the same derivation. 
					if so, we ask whether they are derived via a-bar movement.</p>

				<h2>about</h2>
					<p>i go by jed. if you have to use my full name, note that my name 
					and the name of one of the eels in little mermaid (jetsam) don't 
					form a minimal pair. none of my name's vowels get reduced. </p>
					
					<p>i was born in davao city&mdash;the durian capital of the philippines. 
					i speak dabaw bisaya, a variety of cebuano, natively. i also speak 
					tagalog (or filipino, depending on your language ideologies) since it 
					was part of the national curriculum when i went to school in the 
					philippines. aside: i don't particularly care if you call it tagalog 
					or filipino, but i will fight you if you say they're different languages. 
					filipino is simply the standardized form of tagalog. </p>
					
					<p>when i am not doing linguistics, i am most likely cooking with wine, 
					while adding it to the food as well. my favorite ingredient to work with 
					is coconut cream. i use it when i make desserts (like cassava cake, 
					or sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf), <em>kinilaw</em> (a.k.a filipino ceviche), 
					adobo, etc. i love to cook and feed people because sharing the food i make 
					means sharing my culture. if i'm not busy stuffing myself or cooking 
					to stuff myself and others, i'm probably playing board games and video 
					games, or binging on tv shows and anime. </p>
